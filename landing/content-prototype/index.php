<h3>What We Do</h3>
  <dl>
      <dd>Our projects take one of three forms:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Consultation:</strong> providing direction to your team as you execute projects</li>
          <li><strong>Education:</strong> teaching teams big and small about our areas of expertise</li>
          <li><strong>Implementation:</strong> building beautiful, powerful websites and web applications</li>
        </ul>
      </dd>
    
  </dl>
<p></p>
<h3>How We Do It</h3>
<h4>Principled Work: It's more than just work. It's who we are.</h4>

  <p>Our convictions drive our work, and they affect how we accept projects and build client relationships. </p>  
  <p>The way we build reflects what we believe, who we wish to be, and why we get up in the morning.</p>
