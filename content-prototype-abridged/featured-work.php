    <h2><a href="featured-work.php">Build the coolest new site ever.</a></h2>
      <p>Working with Stry on a ground-up brand and website overhaul was one of those rare occasions where the client hands over near complete creative control. The direction from Stry founder, Dan Oshinsky, was pretty much, "Make the most beautiful news website ever made." Stop by Stry.us for a look around. Be sure to set aside some time, however, because even if the beautiful, responsive design eventually loses your attention, the rich long-form articles will keep you there for hours. </p>

     <p>"Don't bother coming to Sparkbox if you just want a website built. Anybody can do that. Come to Sparkbox if you want an online presence so beautiful it brings the rest of the web to its knees." - Dan Oshinsky, Founder</p>
