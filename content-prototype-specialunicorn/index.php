  <h2><a href="#">Stry.Us Long-Form News Website</a></h2>
  <p><a href="http://stry.us">Go to stry.us</a></p>
  <p>Working with Stry on a ground-up brand and website overhaul was one of those rare occasions where the client hands over near complete creative control. The direction from Stry founder, <a href="#">Dan Oshinsky</a>, was pretty much, "Make the most beautiful news website ever made." Stop by Stry.us for a look around. Be sure to set aside some time, however, because even if the beautiful, responsive design eventually loses your attention, the rich long-form articles will keep you there for hours. </p>

 <h1><a name ="workwith"></a> Working With Us</h1>
<h2>We offer you our brains, sweat, and honesty.</h2>

<h3>What We Do</h3>
  <dl>
      <dd>Our projects take one of three forms:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>We consult:</strong> providing direction to your team as you execute on projects.</li>
          <li><strong>We educate:</strong> teaching teams big and small about our areas of expertise.</li>
          <li><strong>We implement:</strong> building beautiful, powerful websites and web applications.</li>
        </ul>
      </dd>
    
  </dl>
<p></p>
<h3>How We Do It</h3>
<h4>Principled Work: It's more than just work. It's who we are.</h4>

  <p>Our convictions drive our work, and they affect how we accept projects and build client relationships. </p>  
  <p>The way we build reflects what we believe, who we wish to be, and why we get up in the morning.</p>
  <dl>
    <dt>Build Right:</dt>
    <dd>well-crafted work is valuable work. It embraces details, intentionality, and standards.</dd>
    <dt>Solve Problems:</dt>
      <dd>asking right questions of real problems drives work that produces true results.</dd>
    <dt>Honor Content:</dt>
      <dd>the web exists to communicate message and provide function &mdash; these are our primary interests.</dd>
    <dt>Design for Clarity:</dt>
      <dd>design should complement message and never obstruct users from it.</dd>
    <dt>Embrace All Devices:</dt>
      <dd>the measure of a site should be its quality of build, not its dimensions.</dd></dl>
  <p>
  <h3>What You'll Receive</h3>
  <dl>
  <dt>Honesty and Experience</dt>
      <dd>We've been doing this for a long time, and we want you to benefit from our experience. Our goal is to make your project successful, and if it takes a little bit of tough love and honesty to guide you down a more fruitful path, we're willing to say what needs to be said. We expect the same honesty from our clients when solving problems together.</dd>
    <dt>Hourly Work</dt>
      <dd>We've found that fixed-price projects don't serve our clients &mdash; or us &mdash; very well. Working hourly allows us to be flexible as project needs change and creates stronger, more collaborative projects. Our clients are happier with the results, and we're glad to be paid only for the work we've done.</dd>
      <dd>Our rate for implementation is currently $165/hr, consultation is $200/hr, and educational engagements are situationally priced at request.</dd>
    <dt>Initial Engagements</dt>
      <dd>Every project has a life cycle. The most challenging and confusing phase is its birth. With a relatively small initial contract, we've found we can gain an immense amount of knowledge and perspective on new projects. We can then produce really useful planning, project scope, and resource estimates for how to solve your problem.</dd>
      <dd>Our clients can take this knowledge and implement elsewhere, if they choose. Should they decide to continue working with us, we are in an infinitely better place to begin work.</dd>
    <dt>New Processes</dt>
      <dd>We do our best to work in a way that makes good use of our clients' budgets and our time. Seeking the most efficient means for a project can lead to unique process. This is something we ask our clients to be comfortable with. We'll help you understand why we do what we do, and we think you'll enjoy the fresh outlook.</dd>
